* Project Vision
This project aims to build an extensive, intuitive cocktail recipe database and community. The backend-first approach focuses on scalability and data integrity.

* Architecture
- *Backend*: FastAPI with PostgreSQL database
- *Frontend*: Initial prototype in Alpine.js, potentially expanding the tech stack

* Constraints
- Images stored locally
- Authentication: Simple user/pass with extendable JWT tokens

* Schema Design
Design data structures that emphasize normalization and flexibility, ensuring robustness for future iterations.

* Tools & Languages
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- FastAPI with Python for backend
- Alpine.js for lightweight frontend prototyping

* Backlog & Future Plans
- Enhance authentication with OAuth
- Interface improvements and CDN considerations for image assets
