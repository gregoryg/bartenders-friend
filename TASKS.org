#+TITLE: Bartender's Friend - Task Management
#+DATE: 2025-08-03
#+STARTUP: overview

* Current Sprint - Stage 2: Data Expansion & Quality
** Data Source Loading [3/5]
- [X] boston_cocktails.csv (989 cocktails)
- [X] all_drinks.csv (546 cocktails) 
- [ ] the-cocktail-db.csv (635 cocktails) - *IN PROGRESS*
- [ ] stevana-cocktails/*.yml (158 files) - Rich YAML with timing/taste
- [ ] opendrinks/*.json (647 files) - Premium dataset with images

** Data Quality Tasks
- [ ] Enhanced ETL script testing (2025-08-03) [HIGH]
- [ ] Duplicate detection and merging [MED]
- [ ] Unit standardization (oz, ml, dashes, etc.) [MED] 
- [ ] Ingredient categorization and alternatives [LOW]

** Database Optimization
- [ ] Create indexes for common queries [MED]
- [ ] Add foreign key constraints (Stage 3) [LOW]
- [ ] Performance analysis with full dataset [LOW]

* Completed ✅
- [X] PostgreSQL database setup - bartenders_friend created (2025-08-03)
- [X] Relaxed schema implementation - no FK constraints for ETL (2025-08-03)
- [X] Initial ETL pipeline - 1,535 cocktails, 904 ingredients loaded (2025-08-03)
- [X] Cross-reference table - cocktail_ingredients (3,972 relationships) (2025-08-03)
- [X] Glass types population - normalized from source data (2025-08-03)
- [X] Python environment - pandas, sqlalchemy, psycopg2 (2025-08-03)
- [X] Script cleanup - removed superseded etl_stage1.py (2025-08-03)

* Authentication & API Development
- [ ] Initial authentication setup

  - Search endpoints
  - User management APIs

* Backlog

** Data Enhancement
- [ ] Ingredient categorization and substitution logic
- [ ] Recipe instruction standardization
- [ ] Nutrition information integration
- [ ] Cost estimation per cocktail
- [ ] Seasonal ingredient availability

** User Features
- [ ] User recipe submissions and ratings
- [ ] Personal cocktail collections
- [ ] Ingredient inventory tracking
- [ ] Shopping list generation

** Technical Improvements
- [ ] Full-text search implementation
- [ ] Image upload capabilities for user-submitted cocktail photos
- [ ] API rate limiting and caching
- [ ] Database performance optimization

** Frontend Development
- [ ] Initial UI prototype with Alpine.js
- [ ] Mobile experience design
- [ ] Progressive Web App features

* Current Database Status (2025-08-03)
- Total cocktails: 1,535 (990 from boston_cocktails.csv, 545 from all_drinks.csv)
- Total ingredients: 904 unique ingredients
- Instructions: 545 cocktails have preparation instructions
- Relationships: 3,972 cocktail-ingredient relationships loaded
- Glass types: 13 distinct glass types normalized

* ETL Strategy Proven
1. **Stage 1**: Relaxed schema without FK constraints ✅
2. **Stage 2**: Data cleanup and normalization (in progress)
3. **Stage 3**: Add foreign key constraints and relationships

* Unaddressed Questions
1. Should we implement fuzzy matching for similar ingredient names?
2. How to handle measurements like "splash" or "float"?
3. Priority order for conflicting recipes with same name?
4. Image compression strategy for user uploads?
