* ETL Strategy Proven
1. **Stage 1**: Relaxed schema without FK constraints âœ…
2. **Stage 2**: Data cleanup and normalization (in progress)
3. **Stage 3**: Add foreign key constraints and relationships

* Unaddressed Questions
1. Should we implement fuzzy matching for similar ingredient names?
2. How to handle measurements like "splash" or "float"?
3. Priority order for conflicting recipes with same name?
4. Image compression strategy for user uploads?
